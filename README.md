## Project Explanation

    While watching instagram feed we felt it was very easy to comment, share a post with the view it provides. 
    To achieve this, I thought of creating an app that will be solely used for doing Creative review action such as Approving, Rejecting, etc a Creative using just Mobile.

    The current browser view takes around 3 steps to actually view the content before making a final decision over the creative. 

    This was the basic intent to increase the throughput of manual review team.

    To solve this problem, I went on looking for various frameworks to develop a mobile app which can be easily ported to any platform. 

    I tried out and figured that for our problem space, ionic framework was able to solve all the feature requirements that we thought of.

    Using ionic framework it was easy for us to develop and integrate with other JS framework. 

    To fetch the current creative data we simply used the current API exposed for creative review which had all the relevant info that we wanted to showcase.

    Lets go through the current flow of our app which we feel if used by the user can improve its throughput by 3 times as the current view makes it very clear to approve or reject a content in a single scroll.

    The first page is the login page, here we have two user accounts.

    1. Creative reviewer.
    2. Creative Reviewer lead.

    Lets see the flow of creative review user (DIY after login).
    Lets see the flow of creative reviewer lead (DIY after login).

    To conclude:

    We feel, the efficiency could increase by 3 times.
    Easy access for the manual reviewer team.
    Ease of access for business users.
    Since, it provides a UX which eases the users work.
